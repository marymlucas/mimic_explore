# Exploring MIMIC Patient Data

A repo containing my initial explorations of the MIMIC patient databases

To learn more about this data and how to get access to it, please see [https://mimic.mit.edu/](https://mimic.mit.edu/). It is freely available but each user needs to go through a credentialing process before being granted access.  Details on that are on the [Getting Started](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/) page.


## Data 
Following and adapting the steps outlined in [https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code) I have loaded the MIMIC data into PostgreSQL databases running on my local machine.
